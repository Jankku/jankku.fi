      Hello and welcome to my little website. I'm a passionate full-stack developer from
      Finland&nbsp;🇫🇮.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am highly interested in programming, software documentation, testing and deployment, and
      know my way around Linux servers. In web development a good user experience and accessibility
      are important to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I like reading, mostly books, blog posts and articles. I also like listening
      to music. Sometimes I watch documentaries, movies and TV shows. To keep track of everything I
      have read and watched, I created
      <Link href="https://eino.jankku.fi">Eino</Link> — more about it below.
