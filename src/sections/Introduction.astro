      Hello and welcome to my little website. I'm a passionate full-stack developer from
      Finland&nbsp;ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have deep interest in programming, software documentation, testing, and deployment and Linux
      servers. I also enjoy the creative side of web development, particularly UI/UX design and
      accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I like reading, mostly books, blog posts and articles. I also like listening
      to music. Sometimes I watch documentaries, movies and TV shows. To keep track of everything I
      have read and watched, I created
      <Link href="https://eino.jankku.fi">Eino</Link> â€” more about it below.
